        "description": "In Plato's Socrates on Socrates: Socratic Self-Disclosure and the Public Practice of Philosophy, Anne-Marie Schultz analyzes the philosophical and political implications of Plato’s presentation of Socrates’ self-disclosive speech in four dialogues: Theaetetus, Symposium, Apology, and Phaedo. Schultz argues that these moments of Socratic self-disclosure show that Plato’s presentation of “Socrates the narrator” is much more pervasive than the secondary literature typically acknowledges.",
